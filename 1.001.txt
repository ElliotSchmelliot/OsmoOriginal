You awake on the bank of a swift river. You have a pounding
headache and your lower lip and cheek are bleeding. Your light
brown tunic and leather pants are thoroughly torn and there
is seaweed covering your face. As you remove the plant and your
vision clears, you can see spirals of smoke coming from the
chimneys of a nearby town. You make haste to climb the embankment,
licking your lips at the thought of fresh bread. As hard as you
try, you cannot remember the last time you ate or where you are.
As the village comes into view, a man approaches. "You there!"
He yells. "How did you get here? What is your name? Explain
yourself at once!"
