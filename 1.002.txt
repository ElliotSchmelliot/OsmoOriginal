NAME, huh? Well I've heard worse I suppose. You don't
look too bright so I'll make sure to talk real slow for ya. It
just so happens that you're trespassing in our village. We have a
main gate, but you seem to be slipping in from the river side.
So I'm gonna have to go ahead and shoot you with one of my arrows."
The man unslings his bow and notches an arrow, pointing it directly
at you. "Just out of curiosity, what do you do for a living? You
don't look like anyone I've ever seen. Everyone around here is
either a Warrior, Mage, or Rogue. What the hell are you supposed
to be?"
